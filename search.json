    "text": "Introduction\nThis tutorial demonstrates the creation of OPTIC (Opioid Policy Tools and Information Center) style policy wheel data visualizations. These graphs are meant to illustrate the timeline over which state level policies are implemented concurrently. For some examples of these data visualizations, skip to the middle of this tutorial.\n\n\n\nSetup\nTo create one of these graphs, you first need to load in a few R packages:\n\ncirclize (Gu, Z., 2014)\ndata.table (Srinivasan, 2023)\nplyr (Grolemund, 2011)\nlubridate (Grolemund, 2011)\n\nYou also need to load in the appropriate functions from this project’s working directory- we did this below using source.\n\n# loading packages\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(circlize))\nlibrary(data.table)\nlibrary(plyr)\nlibrary(lubridate)\n\n# loading functions\nsource(\"R/fill_in_cells.R\")\nsource(\"R/make_policy_wheel.R\")\nsource(\"R/plot_policy_wheel_internal.R\")\n\nThe R function we use to plot policy wheels is plot_policy_wheels.\n\n\nPlotting Policy wheels\nNext, you need to load in your data. In the code below, we load in a wide version of the data, meaning that there is one row for each state (50 states and DC) and a column for each policy, containing the date each policy was implemented for each state. Next, we rename columns in the wide data so variables are named with the text we want displayed in the graphs.\n\n# reading in a data frame where rows are states, columns are policies, and values are enactment dates\n\n# Dates can come in the forms: \"1/15/2015\", \"2015-01-15\", \"2015\", or \"January 15, 2015\"\ndf_wide &lt;- read.csv('Data/processed/example_data_wide.csv')\nnames(df_wide) = gsub(\"\\\\.\", \" \", names(df_wide))\n\n# renaming variables\nnames(df_wide)[names(df_wide) == \"nal_date_any_nal\"] = \"Any Naloxone Access Law (NAL)\"\nnames(df_wide)[names(df_wide) == \"nal_date_nal_protocol_standing\"] = \"NAL Standing Order or Protocol\"\nnames(df_wide)[names(df_wide) == \"nal_date_nal_Rx_prescriptive_auth\"] = \"NAL Prescriptive Authority\"\n\n# all NAL laws and GSL\nnames(df_wide)[names(df_wide) == \"gsl_date_anygsl\"] = \"Any Good Samaritan Law (GSL)\"\nnames(df_wide)[names(df_wide) == \"gsl_date_gsl_arrest\"] = \"GSL Arrest\"\n\n# NAL laws and medical/rec cannabis access \nnames(df_wide)[names(df_wide) == \"mm_date_effMML\"] = \"Medical Marijuana Law\"\nnames(df_wide)[names(df_wide) == \"mm_date_active_medlegdisp\"] = \"Medical MJ Dispensaries Open\"\nnames(df_wide)[names(df_wide) == \"mm_date_effREC\"] = \"Recreational Marijuana Law\"\nnames(df_wide)[names(df_wide) == \"mm_date_active_dispREC\"] = \"Recreational MJ Store Open\"\n\n# co-prescribing\nnames(df_wide)[names(df_wide) == \"copnal_date_all_prescribe\"] = \"Naloxone Co-prescribing\\nMandating Prescription\"\n\n# looking at the data\nhead(df_wide)\n\n  X state obbt_date_counseling obbt_date_doselimit obbt_date_clincontact\n1 1    AK                 &lt;NA&gt;

This function takes the following arguments:\ndata a dataframe - this should be wide dataset; rows are states and columns contain the dates each policy was passed. Dates can be in the form of “1/15/2015”, “2015-01-15”, “2015”, or “January 15, 2015”- only the year will be kept.\npolicies a character vector containing the names of the policy variables you would like contained in your policy wheels.\nstate_var a string- the name of the variable identifying states by their two letter abbreviation (all caps).\npolicy_intervals a numeric vector stating the time points to create policy wheels for.\nnrows how many rows of policy wheels should be included? defaults to ceiling(length(policy_intervals)/3).\nncols how many columns of policy wheels should be included? defaults to 3.\npanel_width how wide should each panel (each panel contains a policy wheel) be?\npanel_height how tall should each panel be?\nbyrow T/F- should wheels be ordered by rows (horizontally) or by columns (vertically)?\nplot_colors character vector containing the names of the colors corresponding with each policy.\nplot_width how wide should the plot be in total?\nplot_height how tall should the plot be in total (including legend).\nlegend_args extra arguments to be passed on to legend. See ?legend for more details.\nout_file the file path to save the new plot at.\n\n# generating policy wheels\nplot_policy_wheels(data = df_wide,\n                   \n                   # ordering policies by name:\n                  policies = c(\"Any Naloxone Access Law (NAL)\", \"NAL Standing Order or Protocol\", \"NAL Prescriptive Authority\", \"Any Good Samaritan Law (GSL)\", \"GSL Arrest\"),\n                  \n                  # name of the state variable\n                  state_var = \"state\",\n                  \n                  # restrict to relevant policy intervals, for locations that implemented the policy\n                  policy_intervals = c(2010, 2015, 2020),\n                  plot_colors = c(\"#1f77b4\", \"#ff7f0e\", \"#FFFF00\", \"#dab8e5\", \"#9467bd\"),\n                  legend_args = list(x = \"center\", xjust = 0.5, y.intersp = 1.3, x.intersp = 1.3, cex = 2.5, pt.cex = 2.7, bty = \"n\", ncol = 2),\n                  \n                  panel_width = 4,\n                  panel_height = 5,\n                  \n                  # where should the graph be saved?\n                  out_file = \"www/policy_wheel_1.svg\")\n\n[1] 2010\n\n\n[1] 2015\n\n\n[1] 2020\n\n# displaying the new graph\nknitr::include_graphics(\"www/policy_wheel_1.svg\")\n\n\n\n\nReferencing the graph, you can see that the ordering of the policies argument corresponds to the ordering of plot_colors. The policy enactment dates in df were converted to years and split across 3 separate wheels according to policy_intervals. One important thing to note is that policies that were passed before the first year of policy_intervals are still included in the graph. There is an interesting amount of variation in the “in-between” years (2011-2014 and 2016-2019)- so increasing the amount of years displayed might better illustrate these trends. You can see an example of this change below.\n\n# generating policy wheels\nplot_policy_wheels(data = df_wide,\n                   \n                   # ordering policies by name:\n                  policies = c(\"Any Naloxone Access Law (NAL)\", \"NAL Standing Order or Protocol\", \"NAL Prescriptive Authority\", \"Any Good Samaritan Law (GSL)\", \"GSL Arrest\"),\n                  \n                  # name of the state variable\n                  state_var = \"state\",\n                  \n                  # restrict to relevant policy intervals, for locations that implemented the policy\n                  policy_intervals = c(2010, 2013, 2016, 2019, 2021),\n                  plot_colors = c(\"#1f77b4\", \"#ff7f0e\", \"#FFFF00\", \"#dab8e5\", \"#9467bd\"),\n                  legend_args = list(x = \"center\", xjust = 0.5, y.intersp = 1.3, x.intersp = 1.3, cex = 2.5, pt.cex = 2.7, bty = \"n\", ncol = 2),\n                  \n                  panel_width = 4,\n                  panel_height = 5,\n                  \n                  nrows = 2,\n                  ncols = 3,\n                  \n                  # where should the graph be saved?\n                  out_file = \"www/policy_wheel_1_revised.svg\")\n\n[1] 2010\n\n\n[1] 2013\n\n\n[1] 2016\n\n\n[1] 2019\n\n\n[1] 2021\n\n# displaying the new graph\nknitr::include_graphics(\"www/policy_wheel_1_revised.svg\")\n\n\n\n\nIf you are making your own plots, you can also edit the following settings:\n\nplot_width and plot_height: these edit the dimensions of the plot output and will need to be adjusted according to your needs.\nlegend_args: this is a list whose elements will be passed to graphics::legend(). Within the function, two arguments are already configured for you, legend and col, but it’s up to you to configure the remaining. The defaults are probably fine here, but if you want to change anything, refer to ?graphics::legend.\n\nSee another example of a policy wheel below:\n\n# generating policy wheels\nplot_policy_wheels(data = df_wide,\n                   \n                   # ordering policies by name:\n                  policies = c(\"Any Naloxone Access Law (NAL)\", \"NAL Standing Order or Protocol\", \"NAL Prescriptive Authority\",\n                    \"Medical Marijuana Law\", \"Medical MJ Dispensaries Open\", \"Recreational Marijuana Law\", \"Recreational MJ Store Open\"),\n                  \n                  # name of the state variable\n                  state_var = \"state\",\n                  \n                  # restrict to relevant policy intervals, for locations that implemented the policy\n                  policy_intervals = c(2012, 2015, 2018, 2021),\n                  plot_colors = c(\"#1f77b4\", \"#ff7f0e\", \"#FFFF00\", \n                                  \"#f7a8a8\", \"#d62728\", \"#90EE90\",\"#006400\"),\n                  legend_args = list(x = \"center\", xjust = 0.5, y.intersp = 1.3, x.intersp = 1.3, cex = 2.5, pt.cex = 2.7, bty = \"n\", ncol = 2),\n                  \n                  plot_width = 22, \n                  plot_height = 16,\n                  \n                  nrows = 2,\n                  ncols = 2,\n                  panel_width = 5,\n                  panel_height = 6,\n                  \n                  # where should the graph be saved?\n                  out_file = \"www/policy_wheel_2.svg\")\n\n[1] 2012\n\n\n[1] 2015\n\n\n[1] 2018\n\n\n[1] 2021\n\n# displaying the new graph\nknitr::include_graphics(\"www/policy_wheel_2.svg\")\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, we include data for 7 policies at 4 time points in 3 year intervals. Also, note that the nrows and ncols arguments were used to control the layout of the wheels. The result is a bit crowded, and we would recommend including fewer than 7, or even 6 policies in one of these plots. We can infer that most states enacted some form of a Naloxone Access Law (NAL) between 2012 and 2015 (blue). Many of these NALs allowed the distribution of Naloxone through a standing or protocol order (orange), but most states did not pass laws allowing pharmacists prescriptive authority (yellow) until later in the time series. We can also see that the states in the West and North-East tended to pass these policies earlier than states in the Midwest and South. Also notice that medicinal (red) and recreational (green) marijuana laws were enacted around the same time (if not slightly after) NAL in many states.\nLastly, let’s create a plot that shows the association between the commencement of NALs and Naloxone Co-prescribing Laws that mandate prescribing and affect all patients.\n\n# generating policy wheels\nplot_policy_wheels(data = df_wide,\n                   \n                   # ordering policies by name:\n                  policies = c(\"Any Naloxone Access Law (NAL)\", \"NAL Standing Order or Protocol\", \"NAL Prescriptive Authority\",\n                    \"Naloxone Co-prescribing\\nMandating Prescription\"),\n                  \n                  # name of the state variable\n                  state_var = \"state\",\n                  \n                  # restrict to relevant policy intervals, for locations that implemented the policy\n                  policy_intervals = c(2012, 2014, 2016, 2018, 2020, 2022),\n                  plot_colors = c(\"#1f77b4\", \"#ff7f0e\", \"#FFFF00\", \n                                  \"#00b3b3\"),\n                  legend_args = list(x = \"center\", xjust = 0.5, y.intersp = 1.3, x.intersp = 1.3, cex = 2.5, pt.cex = 2.7, bty = \"n\", ncol = 2),\n                  \n                  plot_width = 22, \n                  plot_height = 16,\n                  \n                  panel_width = 5,\n                  panel_height = 6,\n                  \n                  # where should the graph be saved?\n                  out_file = \"www/policy_wheel_3.svg\")\n\n[1] 2012\n\n\n[1] 2014\n\n\n[1] 2016\n\n\n[1] 2018\n\n\n[1] 2020\n\n\n[1] 2022\n\n# displaying the new graph\nknitr::include_graphics(\"www/policy_wheel_3.svg\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSources:\n\nGu, Z. circlize implements and enhances circular visualization in R.

    "text": "Demo for Creating OPTIC Policy Wheels\n\nProgrammers: Joshua Eagan, Max Griswald\nCreated Date: 10/12/2023\n\n\n\nDescription\nThis repository contains code used to create policy wheel data visualizations as seen in OPTIC (Opioid Policy Tools and Information Center) publications, e.g. Pessar, 2021 and Davis, 2024.\n\n\n\nPrograms:\n\ndemo.Rmd - This R Markdown tutorial demonstrates how to create policy wheel data visualizations.\nsetup_example_data.R - This script was used to create the input data for demo.Rmd. The output from this file is included in this repo for convenience, so this does not need to be rerun.\nR/make_policy_wheel.R - This program creates policy wheel data visualizations with custom user data\nR/plot_policy_wheel_internal.R - This function is not called by the user directly- it is called “under the hood” of make_policy_wheel and creates the circular shell for each individual policy wheel.\nR/fill_in_cells.R - This is called by plot_policy_wheel_internal.R, not directly by the user. It takes the user data and fills each cell of the policy wheel according to the dates policies were enacted.\n\n\n\n\nInstructions:\nTo reproduce the demo, follow these steps:\n\nPull this repository to your machine using git pull or by clicking the green drop down button that says code on this page, selecting Download ZIP, and unzipping that file somewhere on your computer.\nMake sure a modern version of R and R Studio are installed on your computer (we used R version 4.4.0).\nMake sure to have the proper toolchain installed: linux: GCC and GNU Make, mac: xcode, windows: rtools. Run Sys.which(\"make\") from R to check that this was successful (if so, the path to the make executable will be returned.)\nLaunch R Studio, and open the policy_wheels.Rproj in the repository you obtained in step 1. You can do this by navigating to file, open file, and double clicking on the project in RStudio’s file explorer.\nRun the line renv::restore() in the console (lower left hand corner of R studio). This installs some software dependencies. Follow the instructions in the console until this is finished running. If this fails, try updating R and R Studio (selecting all the default settings) and double check that you have the proper toolchain installed (step 4).\nOpen the demo.Rmd file- run this file from start to finish by pressing the knit button or (ctrl + shift + k)\n\nIf you wish to reproduce the input data for the demo:\n\nGo through steps 1-5 above if you haven’t already.\nDownload the zip files from each of the following URLs to the Data/raw folder of the repository your just downloaded. Unzip them into Data/raw- they should be named correctly by default.\n\n\nhttps://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/external_publications/EP60000/EP68648/RAND_EP68648-OBBT.zip\nhttps://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/external_publications/EP60000/EP69157/RAND_EP69157-IMD.zip\nhttps://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/external_publications/EP60000/EP68090/RAND_EP68090-NAL.zip\nhttps://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/external_publications/EP60000/EP68218/RAND_EP68218-GSL.zip\nhttps://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/external_publications/EP60000/EP68090/RAND_EP68090_Coprescrib-NAL.zip\nhttps://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/external_publications/EP60000/EP68218/RAND_EP68218-PDMP.zip\nhttps://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/external_publications/EP60000/EP67480/RAND_EP67480-MMPD.zip\n\n\nOpen the file setup_example_data.R, and run that file from start to finish.
